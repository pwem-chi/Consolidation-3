# Consolidation-3
A python program that takes a user inserted DNA string and translates each codon into their respective amino acids
Another functionality it has is that the program will read the DNA.txt file and correct the lowercase letter within and replace it with a proper codon depending on whether the DNA string is mutated or normal
